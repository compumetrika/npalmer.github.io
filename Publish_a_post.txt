Notes on process of writing posts/pages:

    - Make sure that Pelican environment is running:
        source activate blogging
        [todeactivate:   source deactivate blogging]
        (Alternatively, make sure markdown and poelican are installed in current environment.)
    
    - Write up the page in Markdown. 
    
    - Execute the pelican command to create the page(s):
        
        $ pelican ~/Sites/compumetrika/npalmer.github.io/content/   
            # Must run the address to the "content" page. 
            # NOTE ALSO: run this from the "main" file page -- npalmer.github.io
            # -- seems to need some settings here. Also create the output/ dir
            # if it doesn't already exist.
    
        NOTE: to create everything and output it to the *base* directory, for 
              instant publishing, this command will do that:
        
        $ cd ~/Sites/compumetrika/npalmer.github.io/
        $ pelican ./content/ -o ./   
        or
        $ pelican ~/Sites/compumetrika/npalmer.github.io/ -o ~/Sites/compumetrika/npalmer.github.io/
        
        ALSO NOTE: There's probably a way to automatically write the "index.html"
        file such that it points *down one level* to ./output/* and keeps everything 
        clean at the top level. look into this as well. 
    
    
    - start up a little local server and check out the page:
        $ cd ./output
        $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

      Then point a browser to 127.0.0.1:8000 and see how it looks. 
      
      [Sweet, first post looks great!]
      
      Alternatively, can look at the site like this:
        make devserver
        ./develop_server.sh stop    # To stop the server -- ctrl+c won't do it.
   
    - If everything looks goo, need to push it to publishing.
        -- NOTE: looks like I may need to create/save a a githubpages branch. Hmmm. Look into.
        -- Note: So one "organizational" option is to simply dump everything into the same place. 
           This is much more "messy," but also keeps everything in one location. 
           Otherwise, I'll have to host the "generating" content and the actual output in seperate repositories. 
           In a future site, I may use something like two repositories, OR a simple 
           github page with the "page" section as the blog/site. 
           
           Here and now, however, want everything in one place, in one package.
