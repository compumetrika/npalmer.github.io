But the web app for FastMail is superb and the attention to detail has kept me coming back to FastMail through my browser. The FastMail web app on iOS, Mac and Windows feels more like a native app than most generic web interfaces for email and it comes with a lot of functionality.1\n\nThere are many practical reasons to use the FastMail web application, such as server side mail rule management, keyboard shortcuts and file management tools. Perhaps the best reason to login on the web is for the FastMail search options.\n\nThe FastMail documentation is complete but let me introduce some compelling reasons to login to the web app.3\n\nDate filtering in FastMail search is simple. The after and before parameters accept natural language-like values. So after:\"2 weeks ago\" will return mail in the last two weeks. If that's too much to type then after:\"2w\" is the same. This can be combined with other search terms, such as the in parameter. This search returns all messages I've received in the last two weeks that are not in my \"__Bacon\" folder:4\n\nafter:\"2w\" NOT in:__Bacon\n\nThe beauty of the web application is that search expressions can be saved and show up in the folder list sidebar.\n\nThe second power-search option I use regularly is filetype:. For example this search shows all files with a PDF attachments:\n\nfiletype:pdf\n\nThe filetype parameter accepts image|document|presentation|spreadsheet|pdf|image|gif. This is particularly convenient for me since I also organize my email in folders:\n\nfiletype:pdf in:\"Big Ass Project\"\n\nSub-folders are searchable with a dot notation like in:\"Big Ass Project.Design\".\n\nAll of these search shortcuts are available through the FastMail Advanced Search GUI too:\n\nI consider the short syntax less fiddly and easier to trigger. This is especially true when using the keyboard shortcut, forward slash, to access the search box. Saved searches are accessible with the G shortcut, just like regular folders. FastMail is very keyboard friendly.\n\nHere's a tip. Just use 1Password favorites to quickly login to FastMail accounts. I do wish 1Password supported TextExpander though. It would make email responses easier.\u00a0\u21a9\n\nAffiliate link.\u00a0\u21a9\n\nOr at least to get you to read the documentation.\u00a0\u21a9\n\nThat's a folder that is fed by a mail rule. It looks for anything with an unsubscribe link. I don't need to see that stuff during the week. It's like a pre-trash folder and it's not really original.\u00a0\u21a9","dt":"2014-05-02T11:11:43Z","a":"macdrifter","t":["blog","Web"]},{"u":"http:\/\/www.loopinsight.com\/2014\/04\/30\/boyhood\/","d":"Boyhood | The Loop","n":"","dt":"2014-05-01T12:07:18Z","a":"macdrifter","t":["gstar"]},{"u":"http:\/\/johnaugust.com\/2014\/try-to-open-this-pdf-contd","d":"How strong is PDF encryption? | A ton of useful information about screenwriting from screenwriter John August","n":"","dt":"2014-04-30T22:40:32Z","a":"macdrifter","t":["security"]},{"u":"http:\/\/pipeline.corante.com\/archives\/2014\/04\/30\/is_that_food_or_not.php","d":"Is That Food or Not?.

On a more meta level, I'd found a community that I could identify with. The passion of the people using these tools made everything feel more like an experience rather than a means to an end.\n\nI don't think it's a stretch to say that everything I've done in work and pastime since 2008 was affected by those events.\n\nEddie captures exactly why I've been posting concise tutorials about keyboard shortcuts. I'm not about to argue whether there's an efficiency difference between keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicks. I don't care. I just know I feel more focused and generally happier when I keep my fingers on the keyboard.\n\nPractically Efficient is looking really nice. It needs a tad more writing.
