Possible time-use:

    - Work on website

I think the best thing to do now is work on the website. Yeeesssss.....

Things I need to do for website:

    - Init the layout I set up earlier
    
    - Bring over all aspects of old site
    
    - add new aspects of research and research thoughts from recent.
    
    
New thoughts:

    - sticky prices as endogenous from learning process
    
    - krusell-smith as "top-down" approach
    
    - structural estimation as "disciplined approach to fitting abm"
    
    - Wouter's "at least one actual rational agent;"
        - and this generalized to agents of varying levels of 
        
    - experiments as a way to test theories
    
    - horse races as another way to test. 
        -- need to get in touch with Howitt and Ozak?
