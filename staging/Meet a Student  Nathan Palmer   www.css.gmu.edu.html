<p>Nathan M. Palmer is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computational Social Science. His research interests lie in computational economics and agent-based computational finance.</p>
<p>
  <strong>What is your background?</strong><br>
  I a have B.S. in Computer Science. I was a research assistant (RA) at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for a few years after that, then obtained an MA in Economics and am currently a PhD candidate in CSS. </p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose CSS at GMU?</strong><br>
  This is an exciting time for computational research – new tools, both computational and theoretical, are emerging at a high rate. There is more data available to researchers than ever before, and incorporating this into structural models is non-trivial.&nbsp; These together produce a number of open research questions – very exciting for a young researcher. In addition, the CSS Department is strategically located in an area with many opportunities to apply these tools. The Department is located in the thick of much active research, both public and private – a great way to see and experience new tools in action.</p>
<p>  <strong>What courses have you done and what have you enjoyed about them?</strong><br>
  Rob Axtell’s agent-based computational economics course is fantastic. There’s no better way to learn than by doing, and he has you produce a new economic model from scratch every week. It’s one thing to understand Bayesian belief updating with pencil and paper; it’s another thing to actually implement it in a simple model, then implement it again the next week for a more complex model, then think about how to generalize it for further models. </p>
<p>  Aside from Rob’s specific course, I’ve been very happy with the structure I’ve found in many of the classes – almost all courses have final papers instead of final exams. These aren’t simply an essay or a lit review; you the student are told from the beginning thatthe final paper should be presentable in a conference in your area of interest. You are pushed from early on to pursue publication-quality work – an enormous difference versus studying for exams. For Rob’s CSS 610 course, I coded up models of adaptive learning in games. For Andrew’s CSS 645 course, I coded one of Townsend’s general equilibrium models of “land use as a portfolio diversification strategy,” from his fantastic text <a href="http://www.robertmtownsend.net/books" target="_blank">The Medieval Village Economy</a>, as a way to explore rational expectations (and possible deviations) in a specific geographic setting. For CSS 625, I applied some cutting-edge distributional estimation to recent macroeconomic data. For a “fields” course on big data (CSS 739) I ran a basic Glosten-Milgrom financial market on a cluster to try out massive parallel sweeps of a parameter space – something needed for some complex models and good to explore with a well-understood model.</p>
<p>  All of these have informed me quite a bit as I’ve honed my dissertation topic. My current dissertation actually emerged from both my work on Geanakoplos et al. (2012) and my final project in my CSS 600 course (I took this course somewhat out of order).<br>
  If you’re a motivated student, you can start dissertation work extremely early. Of course, there is a chicken-and-egg problem – often you need your courses to get situated in the literature and determine where you want to work. Still, you can focus and start building your research early on.</p>
<p><strong>What is your research area/PhD topic?</strong><br>
 A key problem in large or complicated models is how agents form their policy functions. This is a key tradeoff often faced by modelers: a model must be small and “simple enough” to allow for agents to have truly optimal behavior, <strong>or</strong> a model may be large and complex (for example, allowing extensive heterogeneity among agents, non-trivial market structures, or heterogeneity of agent expectations) but agents must inevitably have non-optimal policy functions – rules of thumb or heuristics. Aside from arguments about “realism of rules of thumb behavior,” fixed policy functions are simply a computational necessity in large-scale or complex models. With respect to the later, I explicitly have in mind models such as the housing market of Geanakoplos et al (2012), in which the environment is non-stationary, the housing market is non-trivial, and there is extensive heterogeneity among agents participating. In such a world, it is extremely difficult to obtain optimal solutions for agent policies. </p>
<p> My research aims to bridge the gap between models which are “small enough to be tractable” and “large enough to be intractable,” with respect to agents’ formation of policy functions, by employing learning algorithms which are a generalization of dynamic programming. These algorithms use agent-level experience as a form of Monte Carlo estimation of value and policy functions. Given some experience, agents can estimate a value function and improve their policy function. The algorithms I employ are commonly referred to as “reinforcement learning” in computer science and “approximate dynamic programming” in operations research and applied mathematics. As such, they have a long history in those literatures – these are not new methods, but rather new applications (with their own new and particular challenges). </p>
<p>Sims (1980) famously stated that non-rational behavior is a “wilderness:” there is only one way for economic agents to be “rational” but infinitely many ways to be non-rational. While this may be strictly true, some paths through the wilderness are more familiar and well-trod than others. There is a small but growing economic literature which employs tools from reinforcement learning and approximate dynamic programming to impose bounded rationality in intertemporal consumption-savings problems. These tools generalize dynamic programming by easing the information requirement on decision makers, who instead learn behavior from trial-and-error experience. This behavior can converge to optimal behavior if the environment is appropriately stationary and experience is long enough; inthe meanwhile, this learning may introduce persistent aggregate dynamics. </p>
<p>My research contributes to this emerging literature by extending one of its earliest models, Allen and Carroll (2001). My primary efforts extend Allen and Carroll's original agent-based consumption-savings model in two ways: first, by incorporate social learning, and second, by introducing a new intuitively motived estimator of the value of a linear consumption function. Both additions improve the time required for agent learning by many orders of magnitude. My research further seeks evidence for this social learning mechanism in empirical data, and I explore general equilibrium effects as well as properties of new reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by Allen and Carroll (2001) which incorporate agent expectations into the learning process.<br>
In addition to these topics, I’ve worked on models of financial markets, such as extensions to Thurner, Farmer, Geanakoplos (2012). </p>
