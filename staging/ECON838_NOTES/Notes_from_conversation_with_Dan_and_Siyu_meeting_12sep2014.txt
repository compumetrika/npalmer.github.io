Notes from conversation with Dan and Siyu:

Broad outline from my notes:

- We are essentially offering a "wider" course

- I'll use the homeworks as a framework for talking about concepts

- The sessions will be a bit free-form. 



My plan for the Fridays:

- Review the previous week's HW. 

- THink about the concepts that this homework would require

- Type up some loose notes 

- Bazanga.
