Summary: In which I discuss some literature. 

This isn't my usual fare, but interesting none-the-less: [Classification of natural language messages using a coordination game](http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Dy_XT9UAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Dy_XT9UAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC)

Here's a perennial question for surveys: how do you handle free-form responses? Free-form response gives subjects the most freedom of expression -- one can perhaps avoid "contaminating" subject responses with the experimenter's desired outcomes. The trouble, of course, is that free-form response is not very amenable to quantitative analysis. In practice, 'content analysis' is the main option - some trained analysts (or the researcher) sits down and manually codes responses.

The paper presents an alternative: the authors use game theory to set up a coordination game on content of the free-form messages. As in Keynes' "beauty contest," the subjects have to assign messages to the category they most believe other coders would also choose. Their payoff is dependent on successful coordination. Very nice -- use incentives to pull out the underlying, unknown social knowledge. I'm tempted to call this an economic-theory formalization of the idea of "inter-coder reliability" from traditional content analysis. 

One wonders if this concept could be "taken one step higher," in the sense that categories themselves are chosen by coordination. Perhaps the first round of coordinating subjects chooses a set of N categories, and a second round of subjects assigns messages to the categories. (Perhaps 10 mote minutes of thinking about it will convince me this isn't useful.)
