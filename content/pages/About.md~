Welcome to my homepage - very much a work in progress! I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computational Social Science](http://www.css.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University, specializing in simulation techniques applied to macroeconomics (learning & consumption behavior) and finance (leverage, liquidity, & contagion). [Rob](http://www.css.gmu.edu/?q=node/27) [Axtell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axtell) [is](http://ideas.repec.org/e/pax2.html) my advisor and I am having a blast working on interesting projects with a lot of very bright people.

Note to prospective CSS students:  If you are interested in pursuing economics or finance in the CSS program, please feel free to send me an email at <npalmer4@masonlive.gmu.edu>. I'm always happy to talk about the work we do and am happy to offer (often blunt) advise as you survey the PhD landscape. 

A similar offer stands for current economists and researchers -- feel free to drop me an email, I'm happy to chat.
