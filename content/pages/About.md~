Some of the biggest questions in large-scale computation, in my opinion:

    -- Agent learning: when state space is too large, we are forced back to the age-old question of agent rationality. People are extremely smart (see _________ article about best machine learning used for shipping routes. "That special something."), but perhaps not omniscient (even in an expectation sense). Static policy functions are a first-pass easiest solution, giving rise to "rules of thumb" in large-scale heterogeneous-agent simulations. Agents which can learn and improve their policy functions are a promixing next step. Computer Science and Applied Mathemtics have explored this approach to dynamic optimzation under the titles of 'Reinforcement Learning" and "Approximate Dynamic Programming," and Economists have begun to explore these methods as well, at times independently from the CS and AP/OR literatures. Models such as ________ and _________ examine simple applications of the most basic classes of RL mechanisms with promising results.

    Given a number of models for agent-level learning, we must still examine whether these are realiztic in 
    
    -- System-wide dynamics: economic models are dynamical systems. When these systems are simple enough, we can make clear statements about their convergence properties. 
    
    -- Fitting to data: large-scale heterogeneous-agent simulations may have a large number of parameters. A researcher with a large quantitiy of data must still determine how to best fit this data to the model. I can be extrememly difficult
