I am a PhD candidate in George Mason's [Department of Computational Social Science](http://www.css.gmu.edu/), specializing in simulation techniques applied to learning and consumption in macroeconomics and finance. 


I focus primarily on learning mechanisms applied to household consumption and finance. My advisor is Rob Axtell.
