ADVICE


Science doesn't happen in a vacuum. If you are a programmer, you know that code vetted and debugged by 3 other programmers is *much* more likely to be low-error than single-author code. It's the same for research but at a broader scale. You may be headed down a path which will reveal itself a dead end in 2 years. If someone else has already found that dead end, you *really* want to know about it. I have had this experience again and again, learning from another's comments (and even criticisms) that I was headed down a dead-end path.

How I wish I had more of it. 

A good friend of mine is a personal trainer, asked me recently: "Are you 'bulking'?"

(For the uninitiated, "bulking" means that you eat at an excess so you gain weight -- but you also lift weights a lot, so that the weight gain is mostly muscle.)

My answer was "I'll be gaining weight one way or another, so it might as well be 'bulking.'"


I think the "grad student bulk/cut cyle" is a much logner game than usual, and maybe goes like this: bulk 5-7 years, then cut. Yikes that sounds terrible typed out. 


that means, "are you eating at an excess (such that you gain weight), while lifting weights (such that the weight gain is mostly muscle)?" My answer was, "yes, one way or another, I am bulking
