These are resources I've found useful in my time as a Computational Social Scientist. They are many and varied. if you have found any paritcular ones useful, or if you have updated suggestions, let me know!


Some of these are free, some are very not-free. In no particular order:






Bayesian Estimation/Computation:

As far as I've seen, Bayesian estiamtion doesn't exist outside of computation, at least in practice. I suppose this is true of all econoemtrics,  but it seems particularly true in Bayesian work -- every solution method I've seen appears to be simulation-based. If this isn't true, let me know!

* Green Tea Press, "Think Bayes"
    -  The "locomotive problem" is still my favorite demonstration of the idea behind Bayesian estimation. Brilliant. It starts with a seemingly impossible problem and then shows that we have much more information that we first imagined -- first through our ability to form as many hypotheses as we want, and second in our knowledge about likelihood of those hypotheses. The importance of computation is also illustrated -- computers make it possible to "push each hypothesis through the update" to get a posterior. Also, later chapters provide great illustrations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (the apparent main competitor to, eg, Metropolis-Hastings), and hierarchical models. The later is likely an empirical candidate for "appropriately" estimating agent-based models with a low data-to-parameters ratio. 
    
* Doing Bayesian Data Analysis
    - Another great resource for digging into the intuition behind MCMC estimation. See chapter ______ in particular, the politician traveling example. Don't skip the mathematics!

Non-Parametric Statistics:

* Dan Houser's ECON 838 course notes, and course textbook. 
    - I strongly recommend Dan's course to any CSS students at Mason. It's a great introduction and overview of non-parametric statistical tests. I didn't properly understand non-parametric stats until I took this course. 




Dynamic Programming/Dynamic Economics:

The first chapter title of Ljungquvist and Sargent's classic "Macroeconomics" text says it all: "The Imperialism of Dynamic Methods in Economics." 

* Stachurski's "Macroeconomic Dynamics," and accompanying website quant-econ.net
    - http://quant-econ.net is now an accompanying website to both John's "Dynamic Macroeconomics" and Sargent's "". I highly recommend getting John's book to accompany you as you work through the notes. He is an excellent teacher and this shows through in his text. One quirk: you will almost certainly be interested in his
